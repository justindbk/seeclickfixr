============

R Wrapper for SeeClickFix API

Provides basic functions to access information reported to cities via the SeeClickFix system in many cities. Can search by city, by issue type in a city, and by a date range within a city. Start with 'list_places()' to see in which cities or sub-neighborhoods data is available, and then check the types of issues you can retrieve with 'get_city_issues()'
